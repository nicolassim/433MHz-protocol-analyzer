# 433MHz Protocol Analyzer for RF light switches

I've developed this small parser in order to reverse engineer a RF light switch protocol and the related code.<br>
I've taken some traces with a saleae logic analyser and with this tiny tool I've figured out which protocol was used 
in which part of the trace.
